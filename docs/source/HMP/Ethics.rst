A Note on Ethics
================================================

Ethical concerns with neural prostheses should differ considerably from 
DBS, aDBS, and clDBS. 
This paper builds on existing models and literature 
on implantable neurological devices to distill unique ethical concerns 
associated with the design, development, and implementation of neural prostheses. 
In doing so, we hope that the resulting recommendations will be of use 
to guide this emerging field of neural engineering as it matures.

For instance, a recent review of the ethical issues related to neuroprosthetics, 
Walter Glannon questions whether a hippocampal prosthesis could be integrated 
into the brain’s memory circuits to maintain important aspects of 
autobiographical memory, such as the interaction between emotional 
and episodic memory, selective meaning attribution, and place cell function 
(Glannon, 2016). 
In reference to case of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, 
Fabrice Jotterand has also pointed out that restoring psychological continuity 
(i.e. memory encoding) to patients would not repair the memories lost to 
neurodegeneration—-and that clinicians have an obligation to help 
restore the integrity of the patient’s personal identity through a 
relational narrative with past events where memory had failed (Jotterand, 2019). 
As more generalizable conclusions are drawn about neural prostheses as a whole, 
however, a deeper understanding of the core technology behind these devices 
will be increasingly beneficial. Glannon: “A person with anterograde 
or retrograde amnesia for many years might have difficulty adjusting 
cognitively and emotionally to what could be a substantial change 
in the content of his mental states” (Glannon 2019, 164)].

In order to effectively design devices that intend to benefit disabled people, 
researchers must, as a matter of justice, 
begin to pay close attention to the actual needs and desires of their end-users 
(Goering & Klein, 2019). 
And what aspects of neural prostheses can UCD affect? [

Consider the following: 
1.	Identification of end users 
2.	Determination of timing and responsibility for end user engagement 
3.	Assessment of the significance of personal interactions with end users 
4.	Comparison of methods for obtaining end user views 
Principled considerations: 
1.	Specification of the values underlying BCI research (e.g., sophistication vs. accessibility) 
2.	Reflection on the ethical reasons to engage end user perspectives
(Sullivan et al., 2018)]
In order to be most effective, qualitative instruments 
should be used to account for potential phenomenological changes 
resulting from implanted devices,
as well as patient preference information 
to inform later risk-benefit assessment 
(FDA, 2016; Gilbert et al., 2019).

 In such cases, the role of scientists, clinicians, and engineers 
 in risk assessment is to estimate the probability of a beneficial 
 or adverse event based on data provided by sponsors 
 or available in the published literature—-but patient input 
 is what improves our estimates on the weight or importance of an event 
 (Benz and Civillico, 2017).
