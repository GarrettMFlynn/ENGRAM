.. note::

    These walkthroughs are written at a **high-school level** and with the assumtion of 
    minimal coding experience. As such, These early modules serve to introduce readers
    to the conceptual material that underpins the code of ENGRAM. As they progress, the 
    material becomes increasingly technical and dependent upon previous modules. 
    **Thus it is recommmended to complete these walkthroughs in a linear fashion.**

    These walkthroughs will be accompanied by visual graphics in the future.

Engrams: A Brief Primer
-----------------------------------
This will acquaint readers with the Law of Engraphy--both in its historical and present forms--
while situating this theory into what ENGRAM means by 
"encoding", "graphical representations", and "activated memories".

How to Build a Memory Prosthesis
-----------------------------------
This is an extensive walkthrough of how to build a memory prosthesis:
a specific application of cortical prostheses.

.. warning::

    Unfortunately the `Restoring Active Memory (RAM) program`_ at USC was not designed to be open source from the start.
    As such, **we cannot release our data since informed consent was not** 
    **obtained from each subject to share their data**
    (though personally identifiable information might be removed to protect subject confidentiality).
