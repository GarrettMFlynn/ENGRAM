Welcome to ENGRAM's Documentation! 
======================================

**EN**\coding **G**\raphical **R**\epresentations of **A**\ctivated **M**\emories is a
Python package for cognitive neural prostheses.

It provides a 
**collection of useful functions for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) modeling and information decoding from multi-channel neurophysiology recordings.**

Though shipped with a fully-functioning application for the DARPA Restoring Active Memory (RAM) program, 
ENGRAM modules should serve as a solid foundation for your own domain-specific prostheses.
