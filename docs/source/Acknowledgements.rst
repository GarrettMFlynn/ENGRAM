ENGRAM was developed at `Song Lab`_ for the `Restoring Active Memory (RAM) program`_,
funded by the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). 

    "DARPA’s end goal for the RAM program is to develop and test a wireless, 
    fully implantable neural interface for human clinical use. 
    To achieve that goal, the program blends fundamental research and 
    technology development. Performer teams are building multi-scale computational 
    models with high spatial and temporal resolution that describe how neurons 
    code declarative memories—the well-defined parcels of knowledge that can 
    be consciously recalled and described in words, such as events, times, 
    and places. Teams are also exploring new methods for analyzing and decoding 
    neural signals to understand how targeted stimulation might be applied to 
    help restore function to the injured brain."
