ENGRAM was developed at `Song Lab`_ for the **Restoring Active Memory (RAM) program,**
funded by the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). 

.. note::
    Both the implementation and documentation of ENGRAM 
    was indirectly informed by Ephyviewer_, EEGLearn_, `Wagner Lab`_,
    Neurotic_, Elephant_, and Neo_

See our :ref:`contributing` section to get to 
know all the wonderful people who've contributed directly to ENGRAM!
