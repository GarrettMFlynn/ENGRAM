Our Philosophy
===============

Though useful for our own lab at the University of Southern California,
we have designed **ENGRAM** to be adopted by the wider neuroscientific community 
for further insight into engram architecture in the mammalian nervous system
**as well as the development of novel neuroprosthetic systems** through the characterization
of engrams that underpin other cognitive processes.

The Law of Engraphy
====================   
    All simultaneous excitations...
    within our organisms form a connected simultaneous complex of excitations which, 
    as such, acts engraphically, 
    that is to say leaves behind it a connected and, 
    to that extent, unified engram-complex" 
    :cite:`Semon1923`

Why ENGRAM?
====================   
Memory encoding remains an elusive process, yet it underpins our entire mental life. *How can we design better tools*
*to characterize the neural mechanisms that underpin memory formation?*

**ENGRAM** allows for the visualization of an engram complex,
"composed of functionally connected engram cell ensembles 
dispersed across multiple brain regions, with each ensemble supporting
the component of the overall memory" :cite:`Josselyneaaw4325`.
Nevertheless, it is still unclear how information is stored
in an engram, how multiple engrams interact, and how they change over time.

With this perspective in mind, **ENGRAM** treats engrams as the basic unit of computation in the brain.

Expanding on previous work in rodents :cite:`Song2017`, **ENGRAM** integrates
hippocampal spiking activity with local field potentials to model the functional
contributions of each recording site **in human epilepsy patients** 
to the process of memory encoding. In particular, we use **ENGRAM** to characterize the 
nonlinear dynamics that underline memory encoding 
(i.e. allocation to an engram) through the use of multi-input multi-output (MIMO)
modeling techniques.

.. note:: 
   Open Questions: 
   What is the best way to visualize an engram *as a dynamic process* rather than a static collection of neurons? 
   What is the minimum UI elements necessary for successful design and testing of neuroprosthetic systems? 

As we move forward, **ENGRAM** may be used as a new method for 
artificial memory manipulation by artificial stimulation of engram
sites in the human hippocampus to enhance (or disrupt) memory encoding. 

Our Values
============

Three key constraints have guided the development of ENGRAM from prototype to publication:

    Accessible
    -----------
    We believe that software should not only be easy-to-use, but also 
    *freely available to use*. 

    Software
    -----------
    Scientific insight is increasingly dependent on sophisticated computational techniques
    (e.g. parallel computing, deep learning, etc). Some things just cannot be done without
    a computer. 


    For Neuroscience
    ------------------
    In general, we hope that ENGRAM might be used as a tool for scientific knowledge-production
    beyond our intentions to implement it in cortical prostheses.
