  **This page is a rough draft of Garrett's thesis project.** 
  All views expressed are his and his alone.

Introduction
--------------------------------------------

**Question:** What are some existing open-source neuroscience projects?

Methods
--------------------------------------------

I did a Google search.

Results
--------------------------------------------

Wagner Lab
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`Wagner Lab`_ is a memory lab at Stanford University that releases all of their 
code with extensive documentation 
and enough functionality to reproduce publication results.
:cite:`Gagnon2018`
:cite:`Waskom2017`

EEGLearn
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

EEGLearn_ is a set of functions for supervised feature learning/classification 
of mental states from EEG based on "EEG images" idea. 
:cite:`Bashivan2016`

Ephyviewer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Ephyviewer_ is a Python library based on pyqtgraph 
for building custom viewers for electrophysiological signals,
video, events, epochs, spike trains,
data tables, and time-frequency representations of signals.

Neurotic
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Neurotic_ is an app for Windows, macOS, and Linux that allows you to 
easily review and annotate your electrophysiology data and simultaneously 
captured video.

Neo
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Neo_ is a Python package for working with electrophysiology data in Python,
together with support for reading a wide range of neurophysiology file formats,
including Spike2, NeuroExplorer, AlphaOmega, Axon, Blackrock, Plexon, Tdt, 
and support for writing to a subset of these formats 
plus non-proprietary formats including HDF5. 
:cite:`Garcia2014`

Elephant
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Elephant_ (Electrophysiology Analysis Toolkit) is an 
emerging open-source, community centered library 
for the analysis of electrophysiological data 
in the Python programming language.
