*ENabling Graphical Representation of Activated Memories (ENGRAM)*


## Introduction
Building on previous work to develop a hippocampal memory prosthesis at Song Lab at the University of Southern California, we propose **Engram:** an open-source software package for the design of novel neuroprosthetic systems. Written in Python, Engram includes functions that train multi-input multi-output (MIMO) and information decoding models on multi-channel neurophysiology recordings.
