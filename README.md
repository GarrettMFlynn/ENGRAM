**Encoding Graphical Representations of Activated Memories**
is an open-source Python package for deriving stable. microscale spatiotemporal representations (i.e. binary and continuous sensor readings) for human-scale events (e.g. image labels, movement patterns, etc). As a first use-case, ENGRAM uses depth electrode recordings from human epilepsy patients to derive stable neural representations for specific memory contents (e.g. animals, plants, buildings, etc).
